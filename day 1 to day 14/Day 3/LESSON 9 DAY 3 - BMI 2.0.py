Instructions
I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x weeks left.
Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

"""
Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.
BMI Chart

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

BMI Formula

Important: you do not need to round the result to the nearest whole number. It's fine to print out a floating point number for this exercise. The interpretation message needs to include the words from the interpretations above. e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = float(input())
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

bmi = weight / height**2

if bmi < 18.5:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
  print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")
