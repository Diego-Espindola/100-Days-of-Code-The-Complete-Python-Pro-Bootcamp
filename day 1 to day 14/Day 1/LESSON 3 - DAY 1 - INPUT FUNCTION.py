# Number one
"""
Try this exercise to understand how tests work with inputs in Auditorium. 
Write some code that multiples together the two numbers in the input area. 
When you run the tests, different inputs will replace the ones in the input area and pass the new inputs through your code.
"""

num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

print(num1 * num2)


# Number two
"""
Instructions

Your code should work for any name.
