# Rules to follow:
# Make your code readable
# Try to make sure that it actually make sense to you
# You can have multiple words in the name of your variable, example:

user_name = input("What is your name?")
# In python we use underscore in order to separate words.
lenght1 = len(user_name)
# You can't put numbers in the begining of the variable.
print(user_name)
# We cannot use the Python's built-in functions to name variables.
