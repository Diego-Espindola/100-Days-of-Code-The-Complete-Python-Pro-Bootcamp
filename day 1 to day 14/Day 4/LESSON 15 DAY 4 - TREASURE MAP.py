This is a difficult challenge. 💪

You are going to write a program that will mark a spot on a map with an X.

In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what it looks like, notice the nesting:

[['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}") to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 grid, each on a new line.

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']
Now it looks a bit more like the coordinates of a real map:

Map Coordinates Example

Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a letter-number system.

List coordinates

So an input of A3 should place an X at the position shown below:

Exmaple location

First, your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

Next, you need to use that input to update your nested list with an "X". Remember that your nested list map actually looks like this:
"""

line1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
line2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
line3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [line1, line2, line3]
print("Hiding your treasure! X marks the spot.")
position = input() # Where do you want to put the treasure?
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆
# Write your code below this row 👇


list_lines = ["A", "B", "C"]
position_collumn = list_lines.index(position[0].upper())
position_line = int(position[1])-1

map[position_line][position_collumn] = "X"
line1 = map[0]
line2 = map[1]
line3 = map[2]


# Write your code above this row 👆
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}")
