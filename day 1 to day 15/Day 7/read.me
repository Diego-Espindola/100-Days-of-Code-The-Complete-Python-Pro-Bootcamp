# Day 7: Hangman Game ðŸŽ®

Welcome to Day 7 of my #100DaysOfCode journey! Today's challenge was to create a Hangman game using Python. 
I've already created a hangman project, that had a dataBase with the words to choose randomly

You can check out my Hangman project [here](https://github.com/Diego-Espindola/Jogos/blob/main/forca.py).

## Project Overview

- **Hangman Game**: The game randomly selects a word from a database and allows the player to guess letters to uncover the word or guess the complete word. With each incorrect guess, the wrong letters and remaining lives are displayed. Players win by correctly guessing the word or lose by exhausting their lives.


## Next Steps

- Enhance the user interface of the Hangman game.
- Implement additional features such as scoring and difficulty levels.
- Explore ways to optimize the code and improve performance.
